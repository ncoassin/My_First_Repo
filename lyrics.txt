May we all get to grow up in our red, white and blue little town
Get a won't-start-hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much
